# Text Generation of a new German Ground Law using an RNN

## Description

This project is the result of an Machine Learning elective at the University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt (h_da) in the Summer semester 2020.
Facing the German Ground Law as the rules our society is based on, I thought it could be interesting to let a RNN (= recursive neural network) reinterpret and write a new German Ground Law.
By rewriting it with Machine Learning this serious and unbelievably important topic suddenly becomes a joke.
I wanted to see if it comes up with at least one law that nobody ever has thought about and thatâ€™s not completely useless.

## Requirements

No requirements are needed, just click on "Run in Google Colab" when looking at the main .ipynb file.
If you want to try it on your own, upload the file 'Grundgesetz.txt' from this repository into Google Colab.

## Usage

This project is purely for fun an has no further use. Just try to read a few laws and search for new rules for our society!

## Authors

The Example it is based on is by the Tensorflow Authors.
Changes were made by Nepomuk Kindermann (Matr. No. 755347) with help of Meghan Kane.
